## SO MY TASK WAS TO MAKE STATIC WEBSITE FOR PORTFOLIO SO FOR THAT I USED HTML AND CSS AND I USED IMAGES FOR THE BACKGROUND AND AS WELL AS FOR THE PRESENTING THE WEBSITE AND I USED FONTAWESOME FOR THE SOCIAL ICON LOGOS AND THEN I WROTE THE CODE AND INSERTED IMAGES WHERE EVER IT WAS NECCESARY. TO GO IN DETAILS FIRST I DOWNLOADED IMAGES FROM GOOGLE AND MADE FILE AND THEN INSERTED THE FILE IN VS CODE AND THEN CREATED FILE NAMES AS INDEX.HTML AND STARTED WRITING MY CODE AND THEN MADE ANOTHER ANOTHER FILE NAMED STYLE.CSS FOR THE COLOR TEXT DESIGN AND ETC AND I USED BOTH FILE ACCORDIMGLY AS REQUIRD DURING CODING AND THIS IS HOW I MADE MY PORTFOLIO.##
